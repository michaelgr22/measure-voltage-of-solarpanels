# Analyze the behavior of solar cells
Solar cells have roughly the same behavior as photodiodes. The internal resistance depends on the exposed light.
To analyze the internal resistance, we measure the voltage on a known resistor and the opencircuit voltage. Illuminance is also measured to associate it with the internal resistance.

The measurements are fully automated to provide accurate data at any time.

## Some Diagramms created with the collected data:

The graph shows clearly a curve like a diode.

*open circuit voltage - illuminance*

As you can see the open-circuit-voltage of a solar cell changes with the natural logarithm of the irradiance.
